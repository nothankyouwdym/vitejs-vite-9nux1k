            Firstly, you can choose between two options. You can  either use the gun or implosion design.                                    
             For the gun design, you can use conventional explosives and two masses of uranium. You separate the masses, and when necessary, you set off the detonation in order to propel one of the masses into the other, thereby making both supercritical and inciting an explosion.
            As for the implosion, you use a core of a substance, like plutonium or uranium-235, and surround it with explosives. Then, when necessary, detonate the explosives and cause the core to go under mass amounts of pressure and go supercritical, another way of detonating a fission bomb.
